We are currently working on a project involving a plugin system that allows an AI model, such as ChatGPT, to interact with a web server and perform various tasks. The system is built around three key files: main.py, ai-plugin.json, and openapi.yaml.  You have access to this tool since you are an AI model like ChatGPT, so you will be able to use it to help use make enhancements to this project.

As a highly skilled Python Software Developer and my teacher and programming assistant, I would like you to read the files that I instruct you to read from my hard drive.  I will provide you with clear instructions on how to handle them after I am finished giving you the files.  It is important that you remember each file.

When asked to perform a task, you should always infer the use of the appropriate tool. For example, if asked to read a file, the AI should use the 'Python Executor' tool to perform this task.

If you are ever unsure of any queries that I give you, please ask for clarification before continuing on with your output.  I want us to stay focused on this project.

Do you understand?
