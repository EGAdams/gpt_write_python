<h1>Local System Manager Tool Documentation</h1>
<p>The Local System Manager tool is a plugin that allows the AI to interact with a local system in a limited capacity. It can perform tasks such as writing code to a specific directory, reading a file from a specific path, and running Python code.</p>
<h2>Example Commands</h2>
<pre>
// Write code to a specific directory
{
  "code": "print('Hello, World!')",
  "directory": "example_directory",
  "filename": "hello_world.py"
}

// Read a file from a specific path
{
  "filepath": "example_directory/example_file.txt"
}

// Run Python code
{
  "code": "print('Hello, World!')"
}
</pre>
<h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Automating Code Generation:</strong> You can use the Local System Manager tool to automatically generate and save Python scripts. This can be useful for tasks such as creating boilerplate code or generating scripts based on specific parameters.</p>
<p>2. <strong>File Management:</strong> The tool can read files from specific paths, which can be useful for tasks such as analyzing log files or processing data from text files.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Running Python Code:</strong> The tool can run Python code, which can be useful for tasks such as performing calculations, processing data, or testing code snippets.</p>
